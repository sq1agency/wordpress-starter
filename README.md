<h2>The Ground Up</h2>

<h6>This is a custom starter kit for wordpress projects. It's based on <a href="https://github.com/stefanerickson/wp-multivitamin" target="_blank">WP Multivitamin</a>, and makes life 1000% easier for creating wordpress websites. It takes the guesswork out of template hierarchy, which can be confusing. The Ground Up WP utilizes Sass for the fancy stuff, Bootstrap-Sass for the heavy stuff, Grunt for the tedious stuff and more.</h6>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<h6>Install this like you would a Wordpress Theme. Drop it into your 'themes' directory and activate it through the dashboard. But be aware... this is <em>not</em> a Wordpress theme. This is a starter kit for building out your own Wordpress projects.</h6>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Clone/download the repo.</li>
  <li>Add the contents to your wp-content/themes folder- it may be preferable to rename the folder to a new theme/project name that you want to use.</li>
  <li>CD into your <strong><em>theme</em></strong> directory (the one you just created with this repo) and run 'grunt'.</li>
  <li>Start creating</li>
  <p>(if you're interested in knowing what grunt is doing for you in this project, read below.)</p>


<h5>Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li><h6>In our project, Grunt is used to watch your sass/js files- clean, concatenate, compile and minify everything for production.</h6></li>
<li><h6>You are required to have <a href="http://thesassway.com/beginner/getting-started-with-sass-and-compass" target="_blank">Sass installed</a>, in order for this project to work.</h6></li>
</ul>
